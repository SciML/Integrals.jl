Documentation Page: https://github.com/SciML/Integrals.jl\n\nMathematical Specification of a Integral Problem\n\nIntegral problems are multi-dimensional integrals defined as:\n\nint_lb^ub f(up) du\n\nwhere p are parameters. u is a Number or AbstractArray whose geometry matches the space being integrated.\n\nProblem Type\n\nConstructors\n\nIntegralProblem{iip}(f,lb,ub,p=NullParameters();                   nout=1, batch = 0, kwargs...)\n\nf: the integrand, dx=f(x,p) for out-of-place or f(dx,x,p) for in-place.\nlb: Either a number or vector of lower bounds.\nub: Either a number or vector of upper bounds.\np: The parameters associated with the problem.\nnout: The output size of the function f. Defaults to 1, i.e., a scalar integral output.\nbatch: The preferred number of points to batch. This allows user-side parallelization  of the integrand. If batch != 0, then each x[:,i] is a different point of the integral  to calculate, and the output should be nout x batchsize. Note that batch is a suggestion  for the number of points, and it is not necessarily true that batch is the same as  batchsize in all algorithms.\nkwargs:: Keyword arguments copied to the solvers.\n\nAdditionally, we can supply iip like IntegralProblem{iip}(...) as true or false to declare at  compile time whether the integrator function is in-place.\n\nFields\n\nThe fields match the names of the constructor arguments.\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"basics/solve/#Common-Solver-Options-(Solve-Keyword-Arguments)","page":"Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)","title":"Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"basics/solve/","page":"Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)","title":"Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)","text":"reltol: Relative tolerance\nabstol: Absolute tolerance\nmaxiters: The maximum number of iterations","category":"page"},{"location":"basics/solve/","page":"Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)","title":"Common Solver Options (Solve Keyword Arguments)","text":"Additionally, the extra keyword arguments are splatted to the library calls, so see the documentation of the integrator library for all of the extra details.
